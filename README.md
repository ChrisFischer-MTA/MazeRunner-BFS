MazeRunner-BFS uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search to search for the shortest path to the end of the maze. I coded this up in two days for programming team as a demonstration.

To use:
Put a picture in local directory named input.png; it must have a purple dot at the start and a red dot at the finish, and the program will attempt to find the shortest POSSIBLE path between the two dots. It interprets white as movable space and everything else as wall.
